# Iris-Classifier-Project-ML
This project is a simple classifier for the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used as a "Hello, World!" example in classification problems. 
## Overview 
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal of this project is to build a classifier that can predict the species of iris flowers based on these features.
